## Launch School

After working with Ruby for 2 years, I decided to go back and learn Ruby once again - this time from first principle!

<a href="https://launchschool.com/">Launch School</a> is a course that focuses on slow learning, despite so many bootcamps doing exactly the opposite.

I am on this 1-2 year long journey with the goal to master Ruby on Rails. 

In this repo, you can see all of the exercises that I complete for LS - I will do my best to keep it organised!
